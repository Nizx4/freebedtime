        <p>Luma was the littlest star in the sky, but she always tried her best to shine the brightest. Every night, she danced between constellations, sparkling with joy. But one evening, she felt very tired. She yawned so wide that—<em>whoosh!</em>—she tumbled out of the sky and floated gently through a little boy’s window.</p>
        <p>Startled but kind, the boy smiled. “You look tired,” he whispered. He placed her in a soft teacup, wrapped a tissue around her like a blanket, and sang her a lullaby.</p>
        <p>Luma twinkled softly, her light dimming as she fell asleep. The boy watched her dream, glowing gently like a nightlight.</p>
        <p>In the morning, a breeze lifted her gently out of the cup. The stars in the sky welcomed her back with cheers. She wasn’t the brightest star that night—but she was the coziest. And that was enough.</p>
