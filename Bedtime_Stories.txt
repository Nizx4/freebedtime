The Sleepy Star
===============
Luma was the littlest star in the sky, but she always tried her best to shine the brightest. Every night, she danced between constellations, sparkling with joy. But one evening, she felt very tired. She yawned so wide that—*whoosh!*—she tumbled out of the sky and floated gently through a little boy’s window.

Startled but kind, the boy smiled. “You look tired,” he whispered. He placed her in a soft teacup, wrapped a tissue around her like a blanket, and sang her a lullaby.

Luma twinkled softly, her light dimming as she fell asleep. The boy watched her dream, glowing gently like a nightlight.

In the morning, a breeze lifted her gently out of the cup. The stars in the sky welcomed her back with cheers. She wasn’t the brightest star that night—but she was the coziest. And that was enough.


Benny the Blanket
=================
Benny was a warm, fuzzy blanket who loved bedtime. Every night, he wrapped himself around his boy, Jack, like a gentle hug.

One night, Jack tossed and turned. He was having a bad dream—a monster was chasing him through a shadowy forest! Benny knew he had to help. He whispered a secret song that only blankets knew: soft hums and rustling like leaves in a breeze.

As Benny hummed, the dream began to change. The forest lit up with stars. The monster turned into a friendly squirrel offering acorns. Jack smiled in his sleep.

Benny snuggled closer and stayed wrapped tight until morning. When Jack woke up, he patted Benny. “You’re the best blanket ever.”

Benny didn’t answer—blankets don’t talk—but he felt proud. He wasn’t just warm. He was brave too.


The Cloud That Couldn’t Rain
============================
Puffy was a little white cloud who floated high above the earth. All the other clouds knew how to rain. They watered fields and filled rivers. But no matter how hard Puffy tried, he couldn’t squeeze out a single drop.

“I’m just not big enough,” he sighed.

One evening, Puffy saw a dry garden below. The flowers drooped sadly, and the ground was cracked. Puffy wanted to help. The moon looked down kindly and said, “You don’t have to be big to make a difference.”

Puffy gathered all his fluff, scrunched tight, and with one deep breath—*plip!*—a drop fell. Then another. And another. The garden below cheered silently, and the flowers perked up one by one.

Puffy beamed. He didn’t need to be the biggest cloud. He just needed to try—and that made all the difference.


Milo the Moon Mouse
===================
Milo was a tiny gray mouse who lived in a hole on the moon. His favorite job? Collecting stars. Every night, he put on his sparkly helmet, bounced along the moon’s craters, and gathered twinkling stars that had wandered too far.

He polished each one and placed it back into the night sky with care. But one night, a star didn’t want to go back. It was hiding behind a crater.

“I’m too shy to shine,” said the star.

Milo sat beside it and shared stories of constellations, galaxies, and brave little stars who twinkled even when they were scared. The star giggled and glowed a little.

“Ready?” asked Milo.

“Okay,” the star whispered.

With a gentle toss, Milo sent the star back into the sky, where it sparkled brighter than ever. Milo waved and smiled. Every star mattered—and sometimes, they just needed a friend.


Tilly the Turtle’s Dream
========================
Tilly was the slowest turtle in her pond, and sometimes, she felt a little left out. The dragonflies zoomed, the frogs leapt, and even the fish swam circles around her.

But at night, Tilly closed her eyes and dreamed big. In her dreams, her shell became a rocket. She zoomed through space, flying past planets, bouncing on Saturn’s rings, and playing tag with comets.

She flew so fast, not even the stars could catch her.

When morning came, Tilly opened her eyes and stretched her legs. The pond looked a little smaller now, but it didn’t matter.

She may move slowly on land, but in her dreams, she soared.


Nico and the Talking Tree
=========================
Nico loved visiting the old oak tree near his backyard. It had thick roots, a giant trunk, and leaves that rustled like whispers. One evening, as the wind blew softly, Nico leaned against the trunk. To his surprise, the tree whispered, “I know lullabies.”

Nico blinked. “You can talk?”

“Only at bedtime,” said the tree with a creaky chuckle.

Nico lay beneath its branches, and the tree began to hum a song. It was a lullaby of the seasons—of blooming flowers, falling leaves, snowy silence, and buzzing bees.

The tree’s voice blended with the rustling wind and chirping crickets. Nico’s eyes grew heavy. As the tree sang on, Nico drifted into the gentlest sleep, safe under nature’s lullaby.


The Pillow Who Snored
=====================
Pip was a small, fluffy pillow who lived on Lucy’s bed. He had one tiny problem—he snored! Every time Lucy rested her head on him, Pip would let out soft, rhythmic snores.

At first, Lucy was surprised. “Why is my pillow snoring?” she asked.

But Pip’s snores weren’t loud—they were comforting. Like ocean waves or a kitten’s purr. Soon, Lucy found she fell asleep faster with Pip’s little sounds.

One night, Lucy had trouble falling asleep. She turned to Pip and whispered, “Can you snore a little louder tonight?”

Pip puffed up proudly and snored the sweetest snore he ever had.

Lucy smiled, and in minutes, she was dreaming about clouds shaped like pillows.

Pip may have been a snorer—but he was the best snoring pillow a kid could ask for.


Zara the Zebra’s Stripes
========================
Zara wasn’t like the other zebras. While they had black and white stripes, Zara’s stripes were all colors of the rainbow. Red, blue, green, and purple—so bright they glowed at night.

Sometimes Zara felt shy. “What if I’m too bright for bedtime?” she wondered.

But one evening, a thick fog covered the savannah. The baby zebras couldn’t find their way home.

Zara stood tall, and her stripes shone through the mist like a rainbow lantern. “Follow me!” she called.

One by one, the zebras followed her glowing stripes safely back to their herd.

Zara’s heart warmed. Her colors weren’t too bright—they were just right.

From that night on, Zara walked proudly. Her stripes made her special, especially when the night felt dark.


Leo’s Lost Yawn
===============
Leo was sleepy—but he just couldn’t yawn. He rubbed his eyes, drank warm milk, even counted sheep. But no yawn came.

“I think I lost it,” he said.

He looked under his bed, behind his curtains, and in his toy box. Still no yawn.

Just then, his cat Whiskers jumped on the bed and gave the biggest, slowest yawn. It was so wide, Leo caught it! His mouth opened in the biggest yawn of his life.

“Ahhhhhh…”

Leo smiled, pulled up his blanket, and closed his eyes. He didn’t even need to count sheep this time.

Sometimes, all it takes is one shared yawn to fall asleep.


The Dream Delivery Bird
=======================
Wisp was a tiny bird with silvery feathers and glowing eyes. She had a very special job—every night, she delivered dreams.

Wisp flew through towns and cities with a satchel full of dreams. Happy dreams, silly dreams, dreams full of magic and kindness. She dropped them gently through windows as children slept.

One night, she paused by a window where a child had cried herself to sleep. Wisp searched her pouch and found the sparkliest dream of all—one filled with stars, hugs, and songs.

She let it float down and watched as the child smiled in her sleep.

Wisp chirped softly and flew on. She never missed a window, never missed a child. And by morning, she was gone—just like a dream.
